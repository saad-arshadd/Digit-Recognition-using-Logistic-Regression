# 📊 Digit Recognition using Logistic Regression

A machine learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using the Logistic Regression algorithm from Scikit-Learn. The model is trained on the popular `load_digits` dataset and achieves high accuracy in recognizing and predicting numeric images.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📥 Utilized `sklearn.datasets.load_digits` for image and label data
- 🧠 Applied **Logistic Regression** for multi-class digit classification
- 📊 Achieved high test accuracy with clear prediction results
- 🔍 Visualized both correctly and incorrectly predicted digits
- 📈 Confusion matrix for performance evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the code
2. Run the Python script (make sure you have the required libraries)
3. Observe the training, prediction, and visualization outputs

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
python digit_recognition.py
